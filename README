****NOTE: This is obsolete now. You should use the libinput Xorg input
driver instead (xserver-xorg-input-libinput on modern Debian or
Ubuntu), which correctly handles the stick and soft buttons as a
single logical device****



This is a small daemon to implement trackpoint-based scrolling on
Thinkpads that don't have physical buttons for the trackpoint
(e.g. the X240 and T440). It uses the XI2 raw event mechanism to
monitor for button presses and trackpoint movement, and the XTest
extension to synthesize scroll events; as such, building it requires
the X11 core headers as well as headers for the XI2 and XTest
extensions.

To build, just run 'make'.

Currently it has a bug where if you have text in the PRIMARY
selection, it will get pasted into the window you're scrolling in when
you start scrolling. I will hopefully address this in a future release.

It also currently does approximately no error handling, but as the
default behavior of Xlib is to explode the client horribly upon any
error, this is not actually as bad as it sounds.

Happy scrolling!
